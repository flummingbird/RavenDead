27th Obsidian, 178

Collected Dôbar's teeth today... Admitedly I never expected to live long enough to use this journal. It is strange that I only thought of this today. 

It was the teeth that got me thinking. As we collected the Dôbar Cagithkilrud's teeth to bury in the south western corner of the Great (albiet unfinished) Drinking Hall, 

I thought it seemed obssessive to collect the teeth that Dôbar had lost (who knows when) at the top of the fort. 

We built our fort much like that of the first and second northern embarks. We carried sandstone blocks to the northern wastes. The second embark having sucessefully struck
 paydirt in the form of the sickening, yet dense Bloodthorns forests of the northern caverns.

I'm getting ahead of this yarn, I must go back to the first days of our embark and gather my thoughts...

I've been reviewing the reports. I feel I must clarify what exactly has happened. Why it troubles me so, and hopefully chronicle these events with the gravity their
 subjects deserve. Melbin was not an evil dwarf. Melbin, like many short and sturdy creature before him, simply lost his poor mind.

Melbin had been shaken by the destruction of several buildings at the hand of a large but simple blue creature we had named Nunùrmokez, a Voracious Cave Crawler. As soon as
 the new mason's workshop was finished, we all hoped that Melbin, would be inspired by the racing thoughts of his mind to do great works and build a great artifact for
 the glory of dwarfkind--Smash it all! for want of bone stone or rock he could not complete his construction. Then reached for his pick--   

I'm afraid I find it hard to write  just now. The crundles are acting up in the depths and I can hear the naked mole-dogs squeelching and squeeking. I must order more cage
 traps... And Moldath Bidnozsazir must be laid to rest. Tobul, may she save us all...

When we set out it seemed we were leaving with meager provisions, stocks of meat, plump helmets and their spawn, no animals besides the haulers, both of whom died due to cold
 or lack of water (most of us haven't spent much time with human surface critters). 5 of us had spent a god ten years honing our skills in the miner's guild of mountainhome.
 How easy we had it there... Our provisions were not meagar, we made up for lack of grub and mead with good sandstone blocks. (It's one of the least dense stones). Our mason-carpenter
 was thoughtful enough to consider bringing a small stock of wood, as well as stone, just enough to make beds doors and mugs for a speedy way to comfort. In case you've never
 mined outside of mountainhome, most surface stuff isn't good stone until a few layers down. (meaning no offense to  against hill dwarves, or anyone in our agrarian clans.
 most mining is done on ore viens and specialty stone in mountainhome. I never thought I would be building walls with a such a skilled mason, and a mechanic. I was also glad
 these sensitive braniacs were willing to pitch in and work fast, if we didn't and even the Mule got a wiff of the blight... it chills my bones to think it,
 but turns their flesh-

Damn my bones,I cannot write more on the mist yet.

(post-scribble comment)

"Valleybridge" is the common tongue, but it sounds ridiculous whon translated, it's not valleys and bridges,
 it's a metaphore. The valley bridges the dwarven worldview... never mind...) Φ

It's strange, it wasn't our first death- but when Melbin picked up his hammer it felt different, it felt like the start of something bad. The omen of twin ravens didn't help.
 Tobul some of these miners are superstitious. But it has always been such, the care and obsessive nature of their superstition help prevent cave ins.
 "Digging cavernwalls never works near the falls." Sorry it's against my religon to write it in runes, it doesn't translate well. It assumes both magma and water in caverns
 (if you're lucky to get both, which we did!) and stones allways roll downstairs the incline where rocks roll--
 nevermind if you're reading this and you're not a dwarf-- gads you're in more trouble than me, or you're a necromancer and I've recently become-- nevermind- Nanoth-ottan

We arrived in Olilsazir on the 4th of Granite in 178. I am the youngest of this expedition, my birth and privelege somehow burdend with the titular role of leader
 (no dwarven nobel would be stupid enough to think any bloodless title is meaningful. But the others seemed to respect my words, nod in agreement, and expect my decisions.
 I had been reading about the mists in the great library after I had word of the first expedition. The second embark was sent two weeks after we had word. Then after a year had
 passed, or more, I often forget the months despite my tutor's constant nattering when I was a child. Time should be measured in stalagmites and stalagtites.
 I have always loved caves... 

We traveled long across the sea from the mountainhome. We passed through the hamlet of the second northern expedition which is only a league or two to the south-east. We hoped
 that in the months to come our progress might be worth some bolder dwarves to chance the mists and aid in our labor. They did eventually much to our surprise they came rather
 quickly, we didn't ask why they took the risk. We opened the doors and invited them down, away from mists and zombie birds (though those were yet to be seen).

The land is bleak. There are no trees, and for once the prospect of not seeing elves give me a bad thought. What I would give to see one of those frail and delicate stalks shiver
 in their boots outside our walls-- but I think the land around us is too sick for even elves to travel through. Red and billowing nimbus would sweep in regularly.
 The second expediton told us they had tired to find the first party. They found the walls but dared not approach for the smell would curl the hair on your toes.

They would not say more. 

It was heartening to know our brothers had carved out a living and found enough growth in the caves for a small industry of zinc and gold. They had even sealed the first
 cavern off from forgoten beasts though numerous dwarves spun yarns about the sounds that resonated though the walls causing mist to fall from the great Tower Caps and Fungiwood.
 They had recently found some lemonite, which would allow them to build up their military. I did hear the cavern shudder but that was after too much wine.
 It's not like we had much time to explore the caverns

We all knew the risk we took. And the second's knew we would increase their chance of survival, being not to far from them. And despite their great sacrifice the members of the
 first northern embark paved the way for us. The second's would not say more, but they studied the records of the firsts, it was clear they had a better digging strategy,
 it was the suggestion of the second's that our plan needed to be faster. Our mason-carpenter suggested the extra stone and wood, to save us a few days at least. 

I can't remember what we decided to do with our anvil. For whatever reason we didn't bring one with us. True, traveling with all the extra mass would slow or progress.
 The mists seemed fast enough to catch a moving cart if the wind was right. It was already a risk, and we could trade for Anvils later.

In the chaos we may have forgotten to trade for the anvils, though we did not have much to trade. It was a bad sign, it made the migrants nervous that we had no weapons yet.

Like the first northern embark, and the second after it, we traveld with 5 miners  (including Melbin and myself), a mason not too unfamiliar with wood, and our mechanic-bookkeeper
 Deler Bûnemäs. It was Deler's traps that would save us. 

We brought no animals of our own, knowing that our journey was taking us to this haunted plain of clay and snow. We heard rumors from the seconds that any animal could be
 infected by the blight mist. We began by digging four stairs down around our wagon. The sandstone blocks were quickly put to use as a walled and roofed fort.
 Our stone walls and floors would be our firstmost defense against the blight. We had brought enough stone and wood with us to build strong doors and hatches to keep out foes,
 and springy wooden beds to sleep away the cold and clammy weather. 

Like the nothern pioneers who have come before us, we knew our salvation was in the depths. The caverns would have game to hunt, and fungus for charcoal. I will admit that
 perhaps we were too eager to delve the depths, not careless, but hasty. Trolls, crawlers and mud men all took their toll on our workshops and doors. It was hard for me to
 call for the death of Nunùrmokez a voracious cave crawler, with hundreads of legs and a toothy maw. I found this rowdy critter amusing and was hoping it could be caught in
 Deler's cage traps. But booze was running low, tempers hot, and of late Melbin, a miner like myself, had taken to strange behavior. Melbin seemed to not know what to do
  until we rebulit the mason's workshop that Nunùrmokez recently trampled. I thought little of it, as far as I knew he had only ever touched stone with his pick. But he got to work
 straight away, ignoring all of us, we all accept the risks of Divine inspiration, it burns a fire in us all... But I did not think it would burn away his mind. 

Then the ravens came. and they were touched by the blight. 

We were expanding the ceiling to cover the recently constructed trade depot. (we could not belive traders had braved the blighted mist to find us). 

Two circling birds could be seen to be.. dancing in the sky to the east. But the mist, the mist came.. where they dancing or fighting... who knows now. The would still fight if
 we let them out...
Raven's being a truly dwarven bird (both skilled with tools, and fond of fine and shiny treasures) we would have been happy to have them as pets. I know some dwarves are boorish
 enough to eat raven, but not without the utmost respect for the birds, though my mother taught me better than to eat raven or thrush (we're not elves though, raven can save your life in a pinch)...

But not these ravens... 

--- 

Somehow these ravens, could still fly in addition to emerging from the blight in a violent frenzy. Two locked claws tearing with feet at the skin of the other, smashing and charging eachother
 like adolescent cave trolls. Slamming into the walls of our upper fort. One of the birds was torn apart... then one of the white eyed birds swooped towards our mason who was leading us in
 finishing the floor one level above our walls. The roof. by human standards but most dwarves never use that word, roof. I've heard Drathla make sounds that might resemble a `roof.`

Our mason punched the raven, and grabbed it by the neck. It pecked and pecked. It went for the wood burner (a newly migrated dwarf) snatching at his toes. It was almost absurd. Dwarves dancing
around ravens and rocks. But this was no child's game. Our new farmer caught the bird briefly before it snatched on to his lip. The terrified dwarf saw the slashes and blood from fighting the other undead raven, and wretched everywhere. This seemed to exite or encourage the raven.

Through corroborating reports and orders we learned after these events that a Troll had been reeking havoc on the magma smelter we had started at the bottom of the second cavern. The milita was
 small but very capable, dispatching Trolls with ease.

Even the farmer, vomiting and fighting off the wretched bird, gained some satisfaction whith improving his fighting skill. 
The farmer was the last dwarf inside the roofed fort. And Deler's trap caught the blighted raven, the damn farmer recovered fully, much to all our amazement. 

He was not the only victim, our gelder was knocked unconcious by the other bird, and thankfully also recovered, moving faster than any stunned dwarf I've ever seen, abliet rather clumsily.
 The second bird was also finally caged, but not before the booze ran out. Is that why Melbin went for the pick? 

By the time the dwarves attacked by the haunted birds were ready to be treated Melbin had started fighting.

True power is gained with blood or passed through blood. Elves think they are so egalitarian, they are just all rich enough to accomodate their frivolous twiggy poetry. Trees have their own
 voices, they need no songs.
