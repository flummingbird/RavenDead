27th Obsidian, 178

Collected Dôbar's teeth today... Admitedly I never expected to live long enough to use this journal. It is strange that I only thought of this today. 
It was the teeth that got me thinking. As we collected the Dôbar Cagithkilrud's teeth to bury in the south western corner of the Great (albiet unfinished) Drinking Hall, 
I thought it seemed obssessive to collect the teeth that Dôbar had lost (who knows when) at the top of the fort. 

We built our fort much like that of the first and second northern embarks. We carried sandstone blocks to the northern wastes. The second embark having sucessefully struck paydirt
in the form of the sickening, yet dense Bloodthorns forests of the northern caverns.

I'm getting ahead of this yarn, I must go back to the first days of our embark and gather my thoughts...

I've been reviewing the reports. I feel I must clarify what exactly has happened. Why it troubles me so, and hopefully chronicle these events with the gravity their
subjects deserve. Melbin was not an evil dwarf. Melbin, like many short and sturdy creature before him, simply lost his poor mind. 
Melbin had been shaken by the destruction of several buildings at the hand of a large but simple blue creature we had named Nunùrmokez, a Voracious Cave Crawler.
As soon as the new mason's workshop was finished, we all hoped that Melbin, would be inspired by the racing thoughts of his mind to do great works and build a great artifact
 for the glory of dwarfkind.

Smash it all! for want of bone stone or rock he could not complete his construction. Then reached for his pick--   

I'm afraid I find it hard to write  just now. The crundles are acting up in the depths and I can hear the naked mole-dogs squeelching and squeeking. I must order more cage traps.

And Moldath Bidnozsazir must be laid to rest. Tobul, may she save us all...

We arrived in Olilsazir on the 4th of Granite in 178. I am the youngest of this expedition, yet have been burdend with the titular role of leader. We traveled long across the
 sea from the mountainhome. We passed through the hamlet of the second northern expedition which is only a league or two to the south-east. The land is bleak.
 There are no trees, and for once the prospect of not seeing elves give me a bad thought. What I would give to see one of those frail and delicate stalks shiver
 in their boots outside our walls-- but I think the land around us is too sick for even elves to travel through.

We had heard of the mists. Red an billowing. The second expediton told us they had tired to find the first party. They found the walls but dared not approach for the smell would
 curl the hair on your toes. They would not say more. 

It was heartening to know our brothers had carved out a living and found enough growth in the caves for a small industry of zinc and gold. They had even sealed the first
 cavern off from forgoten beasts though numerous dwarves spun yarns about the sounds that resonated though the walls causing mist to fall from the great Tower Caps and Fungiwood.

 We knew it was our purpose to seek more military metals. If we did not leave the relative safety of our brothers underground haven, they would be doomed die if we could not
 supply the metals they need.

Like the first northern embark, and the second after it, we traveld with 5 miners, a mason not too unfamiliar with wood, and our mechanic/farmer Dôbar. It was Dôbars traps that
 would save us. 

We brought no animals of our own, knowing that our journey was taking us to this haunted plain of clay and snow. We heard rumors from the seconds that any animal could be
 infected by the blight mist. We began by digging four stairs down around our wagon. The sandstone blocks were quickly put to use as a walled and roofed fort.
 Our stone walls and floors would be our firstmost defense against the blight. We had brought enough stone and wood with us to build strong doors and hatches to keep out foes,
 and springy wooden beds to sleep away the cold and clammy weather. 

Like the nothern pioneers who have come before us, we knew our salvation was in the depths. The caverns would have game to hunt, and fungus for charcoal. I will admit that
 perhaps we were too eager to delve the depths, not careless, but hasty. Trolls, crawlers and mud men all took their toll on our workshops and doors. It was hard for me to
 call for the death of Nunùrmokez a voracious cave crawler, with hundreads of legs and a toothy maw. I found this rowdy critter amusing and was hoping it could be caught in
 Dôbar's cage traps. But booze was running low, tempers hot, and of late Melbin, a miner like myself, had taken to strange behavior. Melbin seemed to not know what to do
  until we rebulit the mason's workshop that Nunùrmokez recently trampled. I thought little of it, as far as I knew he had only ever touched stone with his pick. But he got to work
 straight away, ignoring all of us, we all accept the risks of Divine inspiration, it burns a fire in us all... But I did not think it would burn away his mind. 

Then the ravens came. and they were touched by the blight. 

We were expanding the ceiling to cover the recently constructed trade depot. (we could not belive traders had braved the blighted mist to find us). 

Two circling birds could be seen to be.. dancing in the sky to the east. But the mist, the mist came.. where they dancing or fighting... who knows now. The would still fight if
 we let them out...
Raven's being a truly dwarven bird (both skilled with tools, and fond of fine and shiny treasures) we would have been happy to have them as pets. I know some dwarves are boorish
 enough to eat raven, but not without the utmost respect for the birds, though my mother taught me better (we're not elves though, raven can save your life in a pinch)...

But not these ravens...
